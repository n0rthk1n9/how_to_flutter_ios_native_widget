# how_to_flutter_ios_native_widget

A Flutter project to showcase how to create a native iOS Widget in a Flutter App and push content from the Flutter App to the widget on the native side. To help with that the [flutter_widgetkit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_widgetkit) package is used.

To build and run the project just install all packages with `flutter pub get` and then run in vscode on an iOS simulator for example.
